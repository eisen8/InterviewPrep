These words were generated by AI. I had it generate 100 non-duplicate words for each letter (I did this twice for X, Y,
and Z because it struggled the first time). At the end I also had it generate 200 non-duplicate words that are less than
4 letters long each (which it then chose to only generate 3-letter words).

It definitely struggled with not creating duplicates (even though explicitly prompted to not duplicate). This is especially
true for the letters X, Y, Z which is why I ran them twice. I left the duplicates in the list to showcase this. For example,
the word "Yell" was duplicated 63 times. I proceeded to ask it "are you OK?" and it assured me it was doing fine.
Here are some more stats on the results:

- Expected unique words: 3,100 (26*100 (100 per letter) + 300 (100 more each for x, y, x) + 200 (extra words under 4 letters).
- Actual unique words: 2,328 (772 duplicates... just under 25% of the total words are duplicates)
- Top Duplicated words:
    1. Yell    63 occurrences
    2. Unite   18 occurrences
    3. Zest    14 occurrences
    4. ZigZag  10 occurrences
    5. Zone    10 occurrences
